# Naturalistic_driving_dataset_sample
In this project, we construct a naturalistic driving dataset on a real-vehicle platform. Compared to previous datasets, our dataset has a broad range of modalities, diverse road conditions and a large scale. 
The dataset incorporates three sources of information (i.e., dynamic information of the ego vehicle, traffic environmental information, and driver’s eye movement information), enabling a comprehensive analysis of various maneuvers.
The experimental route spans primary arterials, secondary arterials, primary expressways, secondary expressways, and collector roads, covering common road types in China. 
The dataset is large-scale, totaling 104 hours from fifty-two drivers.
