# Naturalistic_driving_dataset_sample
In this project, we construct a naturalistic driving dataset on a real-vehicle platform. 
Compared to previous datasets, our dataset has a broad range of modalities, diverse road conditions, and a large scale. 

1. The dataset incorporates three sources of information (i.e., dynamic information of the ego vehicle, traffic environmental information, and driverâ€™s eye movement information), enabling a comprehensive analysis of various maneuvers.

2. The experimental route spans primary arterials, secondary arterials, primary expressways, secondary expressways, and collector roads, covering common road types in China. 

3. The dataset is large-scale, totaling 104 hours from fifty-two drivers. 

## Apparatus

The apparatus is shown as below. A Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV, model: Chery Tiggo 8) is equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Global Positioning System (GPS) to collect high-precision motion data via CAN bus. The power supply, inverter, Vector CAN analyzer, dSPACE, and the on-board computer are installed in the trunk.
